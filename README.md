# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-on-Housing-Data
This project focuses on analyzing a dataset containing information about houses. The aim of the project is to gain insights through data visualization by exploring the dataset and creating various visualizations. The project utilizes techniques such as count plots, scatter plot matrices, pie charts, and box plots to effectively visualize and interpret the data.

# Libraries
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

# Data
The dataset used in this project is stored in the file "Housing.csv". It contains information about houses, including features such as area, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, price, furnishing status, and parking availability. The dataset is in a comma-separated values (CSV) format, which can be easily read and manipulated using the Pandas library.

# Usage
To use this project, follow these steps:

- Clone this repository to your local machine.
- Ensure that you have the dataset file "Housing.csv" in the same directory.
- Open the project in your preferred Python environment.
- Run the code in the provided Jupyter Notebook or Python script.
- Explore the visualizations generated by the code and analyze the insights.

# Conclusion
The project demonstrates the power of data visualization in analyzing and understanding housing data. By utilizing various visualization techniques, it provides insights into relationships between variables, distributions of features, and proportions of categories within the dataset. The project highlights the importance of visualizing data to extract meaningful information and patterns, which can aid in making informed decisions or performing further analysis. The code and visualizations can be easily adapted for similar datasets and serve as a foundation for future data exploration and visualization tasks.
